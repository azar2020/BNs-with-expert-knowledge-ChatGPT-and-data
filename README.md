# BNs-with-expert-knowledge-ChatGPT-and-data
 This R script performs a comprehensive analysis and comparison of Bayesian Network (BN) structures using data from Ontario. It evaluates different network models based on BIC scores and Bayes factors, and includes bootstrapping to assess the stability of these scores. The script also performs cross-validation to compare predictive performance and uses statistical tests to analyze errors.

Overview
Setup:
Set working directory and load required libraries.
Data Preparation:
Read and preprocess data by converting it to factors.
Network Structures:
Define and create Bayesian Network structures based on expert knowledge, ChatGPT suggestions, and data-driven methods.
Network Fitting:
Fit Bayesian Networks to the data and compute BIC scores.
Bootstrapping:
Perform bootstrapping to calculate BIC scores and Bayes factors.
Plot BIC scores and Bayes factors.
Cross-Validation:
Perform cross-validation on the networks and evaluate prediction errors.
Statistical Analysis:
Conduct paired t-tests to compare prediction errors across methods.
